# echo-simple
Test CometD 3.0.5 with JQuery.

=======================================
Case: 
Try to get value from input field with CometD and JQuery.

=======================================

This example is based on JQuery echo example in CometD 3.0.5 package. 
It is developed from a Hello World application. 
Furthermore, I tried to simplify the code to make it clearer. 

=======================================
To test: 
- Run
mvn install jetty:run
- Open Firefox, go to http://localhost:8080/echo-simple
